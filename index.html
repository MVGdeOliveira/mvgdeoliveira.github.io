    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>

    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
    <p>Brazilian born in Minas Gerais, I've spent most of my life in Belo Horizonte. This is the capital of Minas Gerais, a state known for its mountains, good food, and warm people. I left it in 2016 to move to Germany, where I lived in Aachen (North Rhine Westphalen) and Saarlouis (Saarland).</p>

    <p>I like to spend my free time cozy with my family - cooking, gardening, playing video games, or reading a book. I also enjoy learning new languages and I am now trying to learn Japanese.</p>
